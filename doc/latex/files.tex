\section{File List}
Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\+Bi\+Con\+Problem/\hyperlink{BiConGraph_8h}{Bi\+Con\+Graph.\+h} \\*Structure to store a graph with heterogeneous edges informations for the Bi\+Con Problem }{\pageref{BiConGraph_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\+Bi\+Con\+Problem/\hyperlink{BiConReduction_8h}{Bi\+Con\+Reduction.\+h} \\*An implementation of the Coca project for 2020 year. Converts a 2-\/coloured graph g and an integer p to a formula true if and only if it exists a translator set of size p. Provides functions to generate the formula and the necessary variables, alongside function to decode a solution from a model of the formula }{\pageref{BiConReduction_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\+Bi\+Con\+Problem/\hyperlink{BiConResolution_8h}{Bi\+Con\+Resolution.\+h} \\*Algorithms to solve directly the Bi\+Con problem }{\pageref{BiConResolution_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/main/\hyperlink{Graph_8h}{Graph.\+h} \\*Structure to store a graph statically, and to access to its informations easily. Includes source and target node informations, and colors }{\pageref{Graph_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/main/\hyperlink{Parsing_8h}{Parsing.\+h} \\*Contains function to convert graphviz files to the Graph\+List structure. Needs first to compile Lexer.\+lÂ and Parser.\+y with bison }{\pageref{Parsing_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/main/\hyperlink{Z3Tools_8h}{Z3\+Tools.\+h} \\*This file contains functions to easily and transparently manipulate the Z3 S\+MT solver as a S\+AT solver without delving too much in the documentation. Note that most functions ask for a Z3\+\_\+context. This is needed by Z3, but in this case, simply create a context at the beginning and pass it as an argument every time needed }{\pageref{Z3Tools_8h}}{}
