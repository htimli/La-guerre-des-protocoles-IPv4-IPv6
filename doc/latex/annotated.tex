\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structBiConGraph}{Bi\+Con\+Graph} \\*The struct containing a graph, its heteregeneous edges, homogenous components, and current translator set }{\pageref{structBiConGraph}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structGraph}{Graph} \\*\+: the graph type. The first four fields are needed to represent a directed graph. The rest depends on needs. Here, the rest represents initial and final states of an automaton }{\pageref{structGraph}}{}
\end{DoxyCompactList}
