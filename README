To build: 'make'

Alternatively, if the 'make' command does not work (it might be your system is different than mine or the one of CREMI), try the following:
- 'mkdir toto'
- 'cd toto'
- 'cmake ..'
- 'make'
This will build the project in the directory 'toto' (you might change this name). The following command will then work, except the command 'make doc', which I do not manage to configure. 'make doc' should work in the root, though.

To build the documentation: 'make doc'

To launch the program: './graphProblemSolver'

A working executable is given. It was compiled at CREMI, so it is wiser to use it only there. To use it: './working-graphProblemSolver'. The usage is given by the program. You might use it to compare with your own solution (its behaviour is only restricted to not display the generated formula by the reduction).

Two example files are given, one to manipulate the graph structure, one to manipulate Z3, they are in the examples folder. You may play with them at your leisure.
To build the Z3 example: 'make Z3Example'
To build the graph example: 'make graphParser'
(note, the make generated by cmake can also build these programs).

Instruction:
    You have to implement the files BiConResolution.c and BiConReduction.c whose prototypes are defined in BiConResolution.h and BiConReduction.h. You should add more functions than the ones given in the latter (and document them).

    You are not allowed to modify any other files than the two aforementioned files. Your program should compile at every step. If you don't finish to code one of the functions expected, let it return a dummy value that won't prevent the program to compile (and make it print that it is not done).

    Some helper function to manipulate instances of the problem, and print results are given in BiConGraph.h. The printing function will warn you if you print an incorrect solution.

    You will only send the BiConProblem folder as your solution.
